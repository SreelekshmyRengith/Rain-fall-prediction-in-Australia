# Rain-fall-prediction-in-Australia
A comparative analysis of various machine learning models to predict rainfall in Australia using the Rain in Australia dataset.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of five different machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Model, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Additionally, cross-validation is employed to assess the modelsâ€™ generalization capabilities. We also generate Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for each model and compare their Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. Finally, based on the evaluation results, we discuss which model is the most suitable for rain prediction in Australia.
